# EASY CODE ( Length-of-Last-Word )
Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string. 

A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

 

## Example 1: 

Input: s = "Hello World"

Output: 5

Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.

## Example 2:

Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "

Output: 4

Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.

## Example 3:

Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"

Output: 6

Explanation: The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.
 

## Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 104

s consists of only English letters and spaces ' '.

There will be at least one word in s.





# MEDIUM CODE( Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree)

Example 1:

Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
Output: 6
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.







# Hard Code (Shortest Paindrome)
You are given a string s. You can convert s to a palindrome by adding characters in front of it.Return the shortest palindrome you can find by performing this transformation.Start checking the string each time if it is a palindrome and if not, then delete the last character and check again. When the string gets reduced to either a palindrome or an empty string then the number of characters deleted from the end till now will be the answer as those characters could have been inserted at the beginning of the original string in the order which will make the string a palindrome.
## Example 1:
Input: s = "aacecaaa"
Output: "aaacecaaa"
## Example 2:
Input: s = "abcd"
Output: "dcbabcd"
